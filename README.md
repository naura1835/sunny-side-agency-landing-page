## My process

After setting up my project files and basic styling for the body, i started off with coding the navigation desktop version and proceeded to the main section, testimonial, and lastly footer, each each as i code the design i make sure i code the active state before moving to another section. Then finally i made it responsive to fit smaller screens

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

Okay for this project i actually learned alot, i learnt about HTML semantics such as `small` and how to use other HTML semantics that i already know about.

But the major learning point for me in this project is SASS. i've used it for other projects but just the basics, so for this project i dived into using mixins and maps, this help me alot to create helper classes which in turn reduces reptition.

Also i am learning how to use git outside of pushing my codes to my repo, i've a grasp of what branching is and how to go at it, so also a plus.

### Continued development

I would love to dive deeper into sass and also git
